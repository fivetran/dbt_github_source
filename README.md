# GitHub Source dbt Package
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
This package cleans, tests, and preps GitHub data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/GitHub). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lx6ez7-x-s-n2JCnCi3SjG4XMmx9ysNUvaNCaWc3I_I/edit). More details can be found in the [Fivetran Source Data Model Docs](tbd).

This package will materialize the following staging models in your warehouse:

# 🤔 Who is the target user of this dbt package?
- You use Fivetran's [GitHub connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/GitHub)
- You use dbt
- You want a staging layer that cleans, tests, and prepares your GitHub data
- (Optional) You want to make use of the [GitHub Modeling dbt Package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github)
# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
To effectively install this package and leverage the pre-made models, you will follow the below steps:
## Step 1: Requirements 
You will need to ensure you have the following requirements before leveraging the dbt package.
### Connector
Have the Fivetran GitHub connector syncing data into your warehouse. 
  - Ensure all the source tables listed [above]() are being synced.
### Database support
This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake and Redshift. Ensure you are using one of these supported databases.

### dbt Version
This dbt package requires you have a functional dbt project that utilizes a dbt version within the respective range `>=1.0.0, <2.0.0`.

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Include the following github_source package version in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/github_source
    version: [">=0.5.0", "<0.6.0"]
```
> Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Step 3: Configure Your Variables
### Database and Schema Variables
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `github` schema. If this is not where your GitHub data is (perhaps your gitHub schema is `github_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  github_source:
    github_database: your_database_name
    github_schema: your_schema_name 
```
### Disabling Model Variables
Your Github connector might not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Github or have actively excluded some tables from your syncs.

If you do not have the `REPO_TEAM` table synced, add the following variable to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
config-version: 2

vars:
    github__using_repo_team: false # by default this is assumed to be true
```

*Note: This package only integrates the above variable. If you'd like to disable other models, please create an [issue](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/issues) specifying which ones.*

## (Optional) Step 4: Additional Configurations
### Change the Build Schema
By default, this package builds the GitHub staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_github`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your GitHub staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    github_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

## Step 5: Finish Setup
Your dbt project is now setup to successfully run the dbt package models! You can now execute `dbt run` and `dbt test` to see the models materialize in your warehouse and execute the data integrity tests applied within the package.

## (Optional) Step 6: Orchestrate your package models with Fivetran
Fivetran offers the ability for you to orchestrate your dbt project through the [Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt) product. Refer to the linked docs for more information on how to setup your project for orchestration through Fivetran. 

# Package Dependency Matrix
This dbt package is dependent on the following dbt packages. For more information on the below packages, refer to the [dbt hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) site.
> **If you have any of these dependent packages in your own `packages.yml` I highly recommend you remove them to ensure there are no package version conflicts.**
```
packages:
  - package: fivetran/fivetran_utils
    version: [">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]
