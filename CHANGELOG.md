# dbt_github_source version.version

## Documentation
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#42](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/42))

# dbt_github_source v0.8.0
[PR #39](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_jira/dbt_github_source/39) contains the following updates:

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Change ðŸš¨
- For consistency with other Fivetran packages, added default target schemas in `dbt_project.yml`. This is a breaking change since the model outputs will now be stored in a schema called `<your target schema>_github_source` by default. You will need to update any of your downstream use cases to point to the new schema. 
  - Refer to [the Change the Build Schema section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/blob/main/README.md#change-the-build-schema) of the README for instructions on how to adjust the output schema.

## Feature updates
- Added field `created_at` to model `stg_github__issue_comment`.
- Updated the source freshness test enablement/disablement to leverage the dbt-core `config: enabled` architecture.

# dbt_github_source v0.7.1

## Fixes
- Updated `src_github.yml` to capitalize Fivetran in the loader definition, to mirror use in other Fivetran packages. ([PR #37](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/37))

## Under the Hood
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job. ([PR #34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/34))
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github). ([PR #34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/34))

# dbt_github_source v0.7.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Change ðŸš¨
- Expanded the variable `github__using_repo_team` to also toggle on/off the `TEAM` table along with and in addition to the `REPO_TEAM` table. This was done to fix issues with dependent models in our transform package, where `TEAM` is only ever used in conjunction with `REPO_TEAM`. ([#32](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/32))

## ðŸŽ‰ Features ðŸŽ‰
- PostgreSQL compatibility! ([#32](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/32))
# dbt_github_source v0.6.0
[PR #26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/26) includes the following breaking changes:
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨:
- Dispatch update for dbt-utils to dbt-core cross-db macros migration. Specifically `{{ dbt_utils.<macro> }}` have been updated to `{{ dbt.<macro> }}` for the below macros:
    - `any_value`
    - `bool_or`
    - `cast_bool_to_text`
    - `concat`
    - `date_trunc`
    - `dateadd`
    - `datediff`
    - `escape_single_quotes`
    - `except`
    - `hash`
    - `intersect`
    - `last_day`
    - `length`
    - `listagg`
    - `position`
    - `replace`
    - `right`
    - `safe_cast`
    - `split_part`
    - `string_literal`
    - `type_bigint`
    - `type_float`
    - `type_int`
    - `type_numeric`
    - `type_string`
    - `type_timestamp`
    - `array_append`
    - `array_concat`
    - `array_construct`
- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

## ðŸŽ‰ Documentation and Feature Updates ðŸŽ‰:
- Updated README documentation for easier navigation and dbt package setup [#26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/26).
- Included the `github_[source_table_name]_identifier` variables for easier flexibility of the package models to refer to differently named sources tables [#26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/26).
- Added Databricks compatibility [#29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/29).

# dbt_github_source v0.5.0

## ðŸš¨  Breaking Changes ðŸš¨ 
- Addition of the `label` source table. This was necessary as the `issue_label` depreciated the `label` column. The respective label information will now be synced within the `label` table. ([#22](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/22))
  - If you do not have the new `label` table in your source, we highly recommend you enable schema changes on your connector and kick off a resync to see the new tables reflected in your source.
# dbt_github_source v0.4.1

## Fixes
- Added the `{{ dbt_utils.type_timestamp() }}` cast function to timestamp fields within the staging models. This is required for Redshift users that have the fields originally synced as `timestamptz`. Without the casting of fields the downstream date functions will fail. ([#19](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/pull/19))

# dbt_github_source v0.4.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. The latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_github_source v0.1.0 -> v0.3.0
Refer to the relevant release notes on the Github repository for specific details for the previous releases. Thank you!
